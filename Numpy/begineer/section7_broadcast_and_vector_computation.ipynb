    "1. **Add a 1D array to a 2D array:** Create a 2D array of shape `(4,3)` and a 1D array of shape `(3,)`. Use broadcasting to add them.\n",

    "3. **Broadcast scaling:** Given a 3D array of shape `(2,3,4)` and a 1D array of shape `(4,)`, multiply them via broadcasting.\n",
    "4. **Real-world task:** Suppose you have a matrix of pixel RGB values of shape `(height, width, 3)` and you want to normalize each channel by its maximum value — do this using broadcasting.\n",
