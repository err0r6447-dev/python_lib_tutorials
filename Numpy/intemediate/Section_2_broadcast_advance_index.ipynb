    "✅ Use broadcasting to avoid unnecessary loops — it’s cleaner and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Keep an eye on shapes using `.shape` and `.ndim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ When unsure, use `np.broadcast_shapes()` to test compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ For clarity, sometimes reshape arrays explicitly with `.reshape()` or `np.newaxis`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 💡 Quick Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create two arrays: `A` with shape `(4, 3)` and `B` with shape `(3,)`. Multiply them using broadcasting.\n",
    "2. From a 2D array of shape `(4, 4)`, extract elements from columns `[1, 3]` for rows `[0, 2, 3]` using fancy indexing.\n",
    "3. Normalize a 2D array *by rows* instead of columns using broadcasting.\n",

    "---\n",
    "### 🏁 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broadcasting** simplifies array operations across different shapes.\n",
    "- **Advanced indexing** allows expressive and powerful data selection.\n",
    "- Combining both leads to elegant, high-performance NumPy code.\n",
