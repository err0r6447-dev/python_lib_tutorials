    "✔ **Use `default_rng()` instead of `np.random`** — it provides reproducible, isolated streams.\n",
    "✔ Always set a **fixed seed** when comparing results or running experiments.\n",

    "✔ Use **`rng.choice`** for sampling from existing data.\n",

    "**Common mistakes:**\n",
    "- Forgetting to seed → results vary across runs.\n",
    "- Using `np.random` (legacy API) → less reproducible.\n",
    "- Confusing `np.random.shuffle` (in-place) with `rng.choice` (returns new array)."
