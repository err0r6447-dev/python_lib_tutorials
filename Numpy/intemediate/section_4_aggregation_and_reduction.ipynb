    "## 🔍 Under the Hood: How Reductions Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, NumPy implements reductions using **C loops over contiguous memory** for each axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `np.sum()` uses a specialized accumulator that iterates efficiently through the array using its **strides** — avoiding Python-level iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process:\n",
    "1. Identify the memory layout and stride pattern.\n",
    "2. Collapse elements along the target axis.\n",
    "3. Accumulate the result using optimized C functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If arrays are **non-contiguous** (e.g., from slicing), NumPy still works — but slightly slower because of non-linear memory access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 🧭 Best Practices and Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use `axis` explicitly — avoid confusion about which dimension is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use `keepdims=True` when you’ll broadcast results back into the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Always specify `dtype` when summing large or mixed-type arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use NumPy’s built-in statistical functions — they’re faster and numerically safer than Python’s `sum()` or `statistics` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Beware of collapsing all axes accidentally when you forget to specify `axis`.\n",

    "- The **axis** parameter defines the direction of reduction.\n",
